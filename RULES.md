# Game Rules

> **Version française disponible :** [RULES-FR.md](RULES-FR.md)

## Objective

Save your worker bees by guiding them to the hive entrance. Complete all 15 levels.

## Core Rules

- You control the **Queen Bee** with your mouse.
- Your worker bees **follow the Queen** automatically.
- Guide bees into the **golden hive** (hexagonal portal) to save them.
- Save **10 bees per level** to advance to the next level.
- If too many bees die and you can't reach 10 saves, it's **game over**.
- If all bees die, it's **game over**.

## The Queen's Power

- The Queen emits a **pheromone protection circle** (golden dashed ring).
- Any predator inside this circle **flees** from the Queen.
- Use your presence to repel predators away from your swarm.

## Dangers

### Predators
- **Predators hunt your bees.** They chase the nearest worker bee.
- A bee caught by a predator **dies instantly**.
- 4 predator types appear progressively:
  - **Hornets** (levels 1-15) - Fast, hunt in groups
  - **Lizards** (levels 5+) - Large detection range
  - **Dragonflies** (levels 8+) - Very fast
  - **Spiders** (levels 12+) - Slow but deadly

### Spider Webs
- Spider webs are **static obstacles** scattered across the garden.
- The number of webs **increases each level**.

## Hive Entrance

- The golden hexagonal portal is the hive entrance.
- It **relocates** after 5 bees are saved or after 15 seconds.
- Watch for its new position when it moves.

## Progression

- 15 levels total.
- Each level adds more predators, new predator types, and more spider webs.
- Completing level 15 wins the game.
- Restarting (R) restarts the **current level**, not level 1.

## Level Phases

| Phase | Levels | New Threat |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 1 | 1-4 | Hornets only |
| 2 | 5-7 | Lizards join |
| 3 | 8-11 | Dragonflies join |
| 4 | 12-15 | Giant spiders join |
